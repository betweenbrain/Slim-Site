 * INTRODUCTION
 * ============
 *
 * Oneweb is an Object Orientated framework and so attempts to separate out
 * everything into re-usable modules. Unlike most other frameworks it tries
 * to abstract the 'design' away from the layout. The intention is that you
 * never have to do battle with the framework.
 *
 * Breaking everything down into maintainable, and easily digestible, chunks
 * makes it easy to find and change what you want and separating the basic
 * design constructs from their styling makes it possible to easily update
 * the framework without breaking your 'design'.
 *
 * HOW DOES IT WORK?
 * =================
 *
 * The Oneweb framework handles basic layout and provides all the css 'tools',
 * while the UI template does all the pretty stuff.
 *
 * STYLEGUIDE
 * ==========
 *
 * For my sanity an yours Oneweb has been authored according to a styleguide,
 * STYLEGUIDE.md
